Sometimes, and specially in large projects, we have to develop UI before we even have a clue of how the API looks like, for this scenarios we have to think it through, but even so, most likely we'll end up with a UI that doesn't match the API directly, so at this point we have to decide if it's possible to just do a small refactor, or if it's actually better to create convert files to handle API to UI and UI to API data convertions correctly, as in some cases we could have some very complex data to handle which can get out of hands if we don't do it the right way.
